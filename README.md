# 🌸 Welcome to My Tech World! 🌸

💻 **Hi, I’m Olivia Grant!**  
I’m a tech influencer, PhD candidate, and your *Go-To Girl for Tech*! I’ve worked with amazing brands like Apple, Razer, Divoom, Grovemade, and Flexispot, sharing my love for tech with over **260,000 subscribers** on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@agenomics). ✨  

🧬 **Science & Tech Enthusiast**  
With a BSc in Biomedical Sciences (University of Essex, 2019) and currently pursuing a PhD in Life Sciences, I specialize in epigenetics. I also co-host *The Genomics Lab Podcast* with Ellie Watson, where we explore topics like DNA nanotechnology and epigenetics since 2021.  

🎥 **What I Do**  
- Tech unboxings & reviews (Apple, Razer, and more!)  
- Workspace setup ideas for productivity 💡  
- Coding tutorials (JavaScript, Python) for beginners 🖥️  
- Vlogs about my life as a PhD student and tech lover  

🌟 **My Journey**  
I started as a catering supervisor at Colchester Zoo for 5 years while in college, before diving into science and tech. Now, I inspire others to blend creativity, science, and technology!  

💖 **A Little About Me**  
I’m a twin (check out pics with my sister on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/agenomicsphd)!) and love lo-fi music, pink sunsets, and coding late at night. 🌙
